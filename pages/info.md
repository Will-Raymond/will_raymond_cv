<h1> About </h1>
This website was built using the Jekyll theme *Feeling Responsive* by <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. The theme can be found on this github repo: https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/

Several minor edits were made to the CSS for taste reasons. If you like this site and are seeking to replicate it, be sure to check out the original theme.
