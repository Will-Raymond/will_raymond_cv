      <h4> About me 
      </h4> 
      <div>
      I am a computational biologist with a background in quantitative data analysis, mechanistic model building, and RNA biology.
      I am currently a 6th year PhD student at Colorado State University in the Munsky lab -- graduating soon in 2023. My focus during my studies here have been on coding TASEP based mRNA models to fit, reproduce, and classify Nascent Chain Tracking (NCT) experiments. 
      I have a deep interest in the questions that plague RNA biology. I hope to provide insight to the scientific community about mRNA dynamics such as ribosomal collision dynamics, mRNA codon selection, mRNA decay, and tRNA abundances during my upcoming career.

      <div>
          Besides RNA, I am passionate about ethics in machine learning, as well as in scientific research as a whole. I haven't had the chance to do scientific outreach past college level, but I hope to change that in the future!

      When I am not working, I love to spend afternoons painting, swimming, or hiking with my partner. Feel free to reach out, I will be fastest to respond over email!
