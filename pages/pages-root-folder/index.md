    <h1> About me 
    </h1> 
    <p> I am a computational biologist with a background in quantitative data analysis, mechanistic model building, and RNA biology.
    I am currently a 6th year PhD student at Colorado State University in the Munsky lab -- graduating soon in 2023. My focus during my studies here have been on coding TASEP based mRNA models to fit, reproduce, and classify Nascent Chain Tracking (NCT) experiments. 
    </p> 
    <p>
    I have an interest in the questions that plague RNA biology. I hope to provide insight to the scientific community about mRNA dynamics such as ribosomal collision dynamics, mRNA codon selection, mRNA decay, and tRNA abundances during my upcoming career.
